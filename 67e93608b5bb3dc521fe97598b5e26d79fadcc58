      "message": "This line immediately breaks all existing configs in the ecosystem, and I don\u0027t see patches to fix all of them, so this line effectively blocks this patch from being able to merge in a timely manner, which hurts the effort overall (because it includes a lot of things that are good).\n\nVariable names, code comments, documentation, and examples all make sense to change, and can be changed without discussion, because it has no impact to the code working.  But this line changes behavior, so I suspect to get this merged we need to support reading both parameter names for a time, ideally with a log warning that the old key name is deprecated, and intended to be removed.",
